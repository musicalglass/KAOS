# KAOS
KAOS is a 64 bit bootable Live CD image with tools for Assembly, C & C++.

KAOS was created to teach, learn, and share knowledge about lower level programming in Machine Code using a consistent platform. 
So tutorials made today will not be obsolete next year due to unforeseen updates of the OS, Applications, IDEs, or hardware incompatibility, etc., etc..

The current image can be downloaded here:

Just insert the CD and restart, and your PC or Apple computer should boot into a new Operating System.

KAOS is based on Suse Studio. You can find the KAOS Operating System appliance at this address if you are interested in the package list or cloning your own Distro:

A number of free programming books can be found in the Documents directory. Just launch the Okular pdf reader, go to File / Open and they should appear in the list :)

youTube video support files are upcoming shortly which will document getting started in Assembly using KAOS

I am interested in learning more about 16 bit old school graphics programming, writing kernels, layout schemes for different kinds of theoretical Operating Systems, etc.

The vision behind KAOS is to create an OS which is entirely documented on video. So any individual or group could build their own OS from scratch just by following the videos :)
